  title: Relearning to program

In the summer of last year, I started working a part time job so that I could start to
generate some income for myself. My goals were to gain more independance, and to get into
a job as a programmer in fairly short order. Unfortunately reality set in, and I had trouble 
balencing a social life, a work life, and my pursuit of programming, so I put my goals
of becoming a professional programmer on the back burner for a little while. I never stopped 
completely, but I transitioned from having large projects, with long sessions of studying, 
to small projects that were really just for fun, and didn't expand my knowledge of programming.
Recently I've decided that I need to get back into programming, and I've found that while I 
still have all my technical knowledge, I seem to have lost the intuitive sense of how to 
problem solve from the the perspective of a peice of software.  

So I've had to start undertaking an interesting journey, I've started relearning to program from scratch, even though I already know all of the technical information I'm reading, I find that reviewing the material again is helping me relearn the rythm that I lost in my year long  
sabbatical. I have no idea if this is the proper approach, but it does seem to be working at least a little bit, so that's good. 

#### That's nice and all, but why did you start writing again?

I stopped writing on this blog in April of last year, but I decided recently that while I am relearning to program, it would probably be helpful to write down my thoughts on these subjects 
as I reabsorb them into my world. So I'll try to write a post once every week or two for the foreseeable future, let's see if I can stick to that. I'll probably also be making some updates to this site as I post, give it some flair that it's sorely lacking. 

While I primarly want to relearn programming, I'm also going to take this autodidact approach
and apply it to other things that I'm interesting, including things like design which I've
always struggled to understand, and things like cooking that I've always had a knack for, but 
that I could nonetheless improve on. I'll probably start posting things on this blog 
that do not relate to programming, so stay tuned for that.
