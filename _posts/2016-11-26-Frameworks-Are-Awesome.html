  title: Frameworks are awesome... but

<p class="post-paragraph">I would assume most people reading this blog know what
a framework is, but in case you don't let me explain. A framework is pretty much
what it sounds like, it gives developers scaffolding for making applications.
For my examples I will be using the the <a class="post-link" href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt Framework</a>,
Qt is a framework for creating cross-platoform GUI applications it offers utilies for things
such as managing windows, reading &amp; writing files, accesssing the internet, drawing GUIs,
and much much more. I use Qt whenever I want to quickly create an application, because it make the more
repetitive parts of programming much faster and easier. But if need be I could create
applications with the same functionality without the framework, and in my opinion
that's a very important thing to be able to do.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Frameworks are fantastic tools for developers
to quickly create applications, and if you're creating any large application
I'd highly suggest that you use one. But I see a lot of new developers making a big
mistake with frameworks, and I made this same mistake when I started out, they think
that a framework is a tool for doing something that they don't know how to do.
That simply isn't what a framework is, a framework is a tool for making the process
of building applications faster and less monotonous. A framework should never be used
in lieu of knowledge, but as an extention of it.</p>


<h4>Why should I know how a framwork works?</h4>
<hr>

<p class="post-paragraph">In my opinion a developer should know how every single line of
code in their project works, all the way down to the CPU instructions. Most
developers probably don't need to be as fastidious as that, but knowing how the tools
you're using work is pretty important. First of all it helps with debugging,
if you're having a problem with your code that you can track down to the framework
you're using, it helps to have an idea of how the framework is working under the hood.
Secondly, if you know how a framework functions, you can choose more efficent ways
of doing things, and efficiency is key in any large application.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Other than making the process of building applications
faster, knowing how a framework works gives you a big advantage in the job market.
Companies want to hire the best, and if you can show a large quanity of knowledge
you will be able to show that you are amongst the best.</p>

<h4>Why use a framework if I already know how to do this stuff?</h4>
<hr>

<p class="post-paragraph">Frameworks can be big, like really big, and they need to
constantly updated to keep in line the with latest standards, security protocols, new platform
features, bug fixes, and innumerable other reasons. So they're not exactly the type
of thing most developers want to take on for themselves.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Beyond the complexity of maintaining a framework, another
reason to use one made by other people is, they're probably better programmers.
Just because I could build a multi-platform GUI application without a framework
doesn't mean that I should, because it would probably be riddle with bugs and be inefficient,
because there are tons of really amazing programmers who work on things like
<a class="post-link" href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a>,
<a class="post-link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
and <a class="post-link" href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>.
No single programmer can hope to be as good as the massive teams that make and maintain
these frameworks, and we're lucky that they made them for us to use.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Please practice proper framework safety.</p>
