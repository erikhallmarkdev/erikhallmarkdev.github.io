      <span class="line"></span>
      <span itemprop="articalBody">
      <p class="post-paragraph">A few weeks ago I started playing arround with the idea
of starting a blog, I could have gone the simple route and used a service like
<a href="https://www.blogger.com/home" class="post-link">Blogger</a> or
<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" class="post-link">Tumblr</a>.
Instead I decided that I wanted to make a blog from scratch, that way I could
have complete control over the code. The first thing I noted is that renting a
server is expensive, so avoiding that cost was a priority, enter
<a href="https://pages.github.com" class="post-link">Github Pages</a>.
Pages isn't much, it's a simple static website hosting service from the good people at
<a href="https://github.com" class="post-link">Github</a>, but that simple service
is all that I need</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">The first obvious problem with hosting a blog as a static website, is that
no one wants to manange all those files by hand, so I knew I was going to need some help.
That help came in the form of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="post-link">Jekyll</a>,
a static site generator made in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" class="post-link">Ruby</a>.
Jekyll was made for this exact type of thing, and it's unbelievably easy to use. It's blog aware
so putting together a simple blog is one of the easiest things I've ever done,
and there are a ton of amazing plugins such as <a href="https://github.com/octopress/autoprefixer" class="post-link">Octopress Autoprefixer</a>
which I use for the prefixing on this site. </p>

<h4>How Do I Make One Of These Sites For Myself?</h4>
<span class="line"></span>

<p class="post-paragraph">Getting started with Jekyll is very simple, and takes
  just three commands in your system terminal (Assuming that you have ruby installed on your system)</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  <span class="nv">$ </span>gem install jekyll
  <span class="nv">$ </span>jekyll new my-site-name
  <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>my-site-name
  <span class="nv">$ </span>jekyll serve</code></pre></figure>

<p class="post-paragraph">
  That's it. After that you have a server running at the adress specified in the
  terminal output(Normally 127.0.0.1:4000). This server will automaticly rebuild
  the site if you change a file. When you want to build the site for deployment
  I'd suggest you use <span class="snippet">jekyll build</span>, it builds the URLs
  based off of your <span class="snippet">_config.yml</span> file, instead of localhost.
</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Once you have the basic site setup, it's pretty simple to
  configure just the way you want it, you can stick with the built in theme that Jekyll
  provides, download one off the web, or you can make a completely custom design like I have.
</p>

<h4>How Do I Customize My Jekyll Site To Look The Way I Want it?</h4>
<span class="line"></span>

<p class="post-paragraph">Customizing a Jekyll site is pretty simple,
if you know HTML/CSS you should be fine. Jekyll uses a template engine called
<a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" class="post-link">Liquid Templates</a>,
which adds some usefull templating systems to HTML. For instance let's say that you
wanted to make sure that the title of your page contained the specific title
of your blog post, all you have to do is add this to the template.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-liquid" data-lang="liquid">  &lt;title&gt;<span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p class="post-paragraph">You can even use conditional logic to check if certain data exists like so.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-liquid" data-lang="liquid">  &lt;title&gt;<span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span> <span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span> <span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span> My Website <span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">endif</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p class="post-paragraph">
That will check to see if the page has a title varible assigned to it,
if it does then it will set the HTML title to the page title, if the page
doesn't have a title it will just add the standard title.
</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">One of the most powerful tools that Liquid provides
  is filters. Filters allow you to modify the output of the Liquid output
  markup. Let me demonstrate with some simple usages of filters.</p>


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-liquid" data-lang="liquid">  &lt;span class="date"&gt;<span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">date</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">date</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"%b %-d, %Y"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p class="blog-excerpt"&gt;<span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">excerpt</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">strip_html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">truncatewords</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">35</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p class="post-paragraph">This will do two  things. First it will create a date
  section for the blog post which it's formating with the <span class="snippet">date</span>
  filter, then it creates an excerpt section, strips away the HTML elements, and truncates
  the excerpt down to 35 words. I do this exact process on the <a href="/" class="post-link">main page</a>
  of my website.
</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Liquid also allows you to include prewritten files
via the templating system, and it's very simple to implement. In your Jekyll source
folder you'll create two folders(If they don't exist yet) these folders are
<span class="snippet">_includes</span> and <span class="snippet">_layouts</span>
your layouts folder will contain the layouts for your pages, this page is using a layout
I've called <span class="snippet">post</span>, from the layout you
can include items from the <span class="snippet">_layouts</span> folder with the following
code</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-liquid" data-lang="liquid">  <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">include</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p class="post-paragraph">Where <span class="snippet">include.html</span> is the
file you want to grab from the <span class="snippet">_includes</span> folder. But it doesn't just have to be HTML
files, you can also use Markdown, or a number of other languages are avalible via plugins.
