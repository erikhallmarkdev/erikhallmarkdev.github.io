<h1>Envy</h1>
<span class="line"></span>

<p>Envy is a simple Node/Value configuration language designed to make writing and
reading configuration documents as fast and simple as posible. Envy offers a simple
yet power syntax that is incredibly quick to learn.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this there is only a
<a href="https://github.com/erikhallmarkdev/envy.net" class="post-link" target="_blank"> .NET build of Envy,</a>
but many more languages are in the works, including JavaScript, C++, and Python.</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<span class="line"></span>

<p>Envy is a lightweight, text based, language independent configuration language.</p>

<p>Envy can hold three basic types of data <span class="snippet">Bools,</span>
<span class="snippet">Numbers,</span> and <span class="snippet">Strings.</span>
This data is stored in a hierarchy of <span class="snippet">Items,</span>
<span class="snippet">Values,</span> and <span class="snippet">Nodes.</span></p>

<p>Items are a single piece of data, they can be a Bool, a Number, or a String.</p>

<p>Values essentially arrays of items, they can store as many items as needed</p>

<p>Nodes are a group of values and other nodes. A node identifies the nodes and
values that it holds with names, a name can be composed of letters, numbers, and
underscores but the first character must be a letter. Each value in a node has a
unique name, but a multiple nodes can all share the same name.</p>

<h3>The Syntax</h3>
<span class="line"></span>

<p>An item can be be one of three things

  <ul>
    <li>A bool can be written as a simple "true" or "false" in Envy.</li>
    <li>A number can be any number, negative or possitive, with as many numbers after the decimal place as needed</li>
    <li>A string is just texted held between two quotation marks. <i>Note that a quotation mark will not count if it is escaped with a backslash</i></li>
  </ul>

</p>

<h3>Example Code</h3>
<span class="line"></span>

{% highlight envy %}

value ( "Hello, world!" )
OtherValue ( "Strings, bools, numbers, oh my!", true, false, 3.1415 )

Node {
  value ( "Value within node" )
  #Comment

  NestedNode {

  }

  NestedNode { #Note that these two nodes share the same name, nodes can do that, values cannot.

  }
}

{% endhighlight  %}
